# Security Audit for Botium Toys  

## üìù Overview  
This repository contains the findings, risk assessment, and recommendations from a security audit conducted for **Botium Toys**. The goal of this audit was to assess existing assets, determine security vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations to improve the overall security posture of the organization.  

## üîç Audit Scope & Goals  
### **Scope:**  
The audit covers the entire security program at Botium Toys, including:  
- Employee equipment (desktops, laptops, smartphones, etc.)  
- Internal network and systems  
- Management of software and services (accounting, telecommunication, ecommerce, inventory)  
- Internet access, data retention, and storage  
- Legacy system maintenance  

### **Goals:**  
The primary goal is to evaluate the existing security controls and compliance measures in place and identify best practices that need to be implemented to enhance Botium Toys‚Äô security framework.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Findings  
### **Risk Description:**  
There is inadequate management of assets, and Botium Toys is not fully compliant with U.S. and international standards and regulations. This includes gaps in security controls, which could lead to data breaches or other risks.  

### **Control Best Practices:**  
The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** was used for assessing the controls. Specifically, the first function, **Identify**, was a key focus. Asset classification and risk identification were prioritized to mitigate risks associated with business continuity.

### **Risk Score:**  
The current risk score is **8/10**, which reflects a fairly high risk due to missing security controls and inadequate adherence to compliance standards.  

### **Additional Comments:**  
- All employees have unrestricted access to internal data, including sensitive customer information like PII/SPII and credit card details.  
- Encryption is not used for sensitive data, including credit card information.  
- Key security measures like **least privilege access**, **separation of duties**, and **intrusion detection** are not in place.  
- The company does not have disaster recovery plans or proper data backup practices.  
- There is no centralized **password management system** or strong password policies.
